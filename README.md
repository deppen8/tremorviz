## About
This is a sub-project of a [Geohackweek](https://geohackweek.github.io/) team project I was a part of. You can read more broadly about our group project at its [dedicated repo](https://github.com/geohackweek/ghw2018_tremorviz). The work here is a Bokeh-based version of the data visualization that we worked on.
